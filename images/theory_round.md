# Theory Round Interface

This is a placeholder for the theory round interface screenshot. In a real implementation, this would be replaced with an actual screenshot showing:

- Multiple-choice question interface
- Answer selection mechanism
- Immediate feedback display
- Detailed explanation of correct answers
- Topic categorization and progress tracking
```

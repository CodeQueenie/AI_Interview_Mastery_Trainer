# Dashboard Screenshot

This is a placeholder for the dashboard screenshot. In a real implementation, this would be replaced with an actual screenshot of the application's dashboard showing performance metrics, progress tracking, and analytics visualizations.

Key elements that would be visible:
- User performance metrics
- Question category distribution
- Progress over time chart
- Strengths and weaknesses analysis
- Recommended focus areas
```

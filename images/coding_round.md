# Coding Round Interface

This is a placeholder for the coding round interface screenshot. In a real implementation, this would be replaced with an actual screenshot showing:

- Problem statement with constraints
- Code editor interface
- Brute force vs. optimal solution comparison
- Time and space complexity analysis
- Execution results and feedback
```

# Algorithm Design Round Interface

This is a placeholder for the algorithm design round interface screenshot. In a real implementation, this would be replaced with an actual screenshot showing:

- Problem statement for predictive/deep learning scenario
- Step-by-step walkthrough interface
- Model performance visualization
- Pseudocode implementation area
- Evaluation metrics and feedback
```

"""
Merged and Enhanced Algorithm Design Questions for AI Interview Mastery Trainer

This module combines the best elements of both previous versions:
- Uses the expanded difficulty levels and question variety.
- Retains visualization capabilities for model performance analysis.
- Maintains detailed evaluation criteria and key considerations.
- Adds an interactive step-by-step walkthrough functionality.
